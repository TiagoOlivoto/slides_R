# O desafio...

&lt;img src="figs/graofolha.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Tamanhos de diferentes estruturas da planta do linho. (a) folhas com 20 dias após a semeadura; (b) folhas com 80 dias após a semeadura; (c) cápsulas destacadas; (d) grãos de linhaça. A barra vermelha representa 2 cm.

# Como preencher essa lacuna?
## As imagens digitais são compostas por elementos de imagem (pixels)

## Cada pixel é o resultado da adição de cores R (red) G (green) e B (blue)
